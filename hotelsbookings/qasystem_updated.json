On your first day here indulge in water sports or camel or bike rides at the Alibaug and Nagaon beaches.The next day go exploring the important Kolaba and Murud-Janjira forts and end the day with a nice local fish or vegetarian thali at Hotel Sanman, one of the most famous eateries in Alibaug. On day three, head about 32 kilometres away to Kashid Beach where you can enjoy surfing and spot a few dolphins.<br><br> Day 2, Dahanu-Bordi Beach <br> Located along the Thane coastline, the Dahanu-Bordi Beach is a calm and serene beach that is not yet explored to its fullest. Ideal for a three day trip from Mumbai, here you can go trekking, explore the pristine beaches and even enjoy a few water sports.Since the beach is located about a three-hour drive away from Mumbai, you have enough time to explore the beach town in two days; you can save the third day to just relax and unwind in nature’s company before you get back to the grind.<br><br>Day 3, Ganpatipule <br> The drive to Ganptipule takes about seven hours, so to reach by mid-day, you will have to leave Mumbai early in the morning. On your first day, you’re bound to be a little tired, so do some light walking around villages to experience local culture.\n\nOn the second day, head out to the beach and spend the whole morning swimming or just relaxing by the beach side. Save the third day for visiting one of the most important temples in Maharashtra, the Swayambhu Ganesh Temple. While you’re there, enjoy local delicacies at one of the many restaurants near the temple.<br><br>"]
